### 📋 Lists
- List creation and slicing
- Iteration using `for`, `while`, and list comprehensions
- List functions: `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `copy()`, `extend()`, `sort()`, `clear()`
- Problem-solving with lists

### 📌 Tuples
- Tuple basics and immutability
- Indexing, slicing, and iteration
- Conversion between tuples and lists
- Tuple methods: `index()`, `count()`

### 📂 Dictionaries
- Key-value pair structure
- Accessing, updating, and removing elements
- Dictionary methods: `get()`, `items()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `pop()`, `popitem()`, `setdefault()`, `update()`, `copy()`
- Nested dictionaries
- Dictionary-based problem solving

### 🧾 JSON
- Working with JSON in Python
- `json.loads()`, `json.dumps()`, `json.dump()`
- Pretty printing and accessing nested JSON values

### 🔁 Sets
- Set creation and uniqueness
- Common operations: `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, `pop()`, `clear()`
- Set functions: `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`, `symmetric_difference()`
- Checking subsets and supersets
- Set-based problems
